# Starcraft 2 custom datasapace assets

I want someplace to store/share assets I make/reuse, but since I've only had small experience with github, it's the only thing I know for now, so I'm doing it this way :D

If anyone wants to use these assets or add their own to the list - feel free to do so.

# Abilities

||Ability: Storm Spiral|
|-------------| ------------- |
||![](Assets/AbilityRaidStormSpiral.gif)|
|Source: |Spec Ops: Raid (by duckies, unreleased)|
|Asset Type:| Ability, creep ability|
|Description:| Summons two beams of energy that will spiral outward damaging enemies they hit. Can damage same enemy once every second.|
|Editor Level:| Moderate|
|Data Tags:| Dummy units, kinetics|
|Editor Notes:| Creates units with offset, then applies kinetics for rotation and force effects to push units outwards. There are 3 sets of kinetics for different rotation speeds. Faster starting kinetics are replaced with slower kinetics so that ability could be dodged as it expands. By default ability creates 2 beams, but it can be easily adjusted for more, with some trigger help to create offsets. Trigger example is included in testmap.|
